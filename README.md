<h1>TechSearch</h1>

Requires you to allow pop-ups!

Basic search tool that allows you to search for results from multiple sources at once, specifically tailored towards developers, built with react. If you often look up how to do something, and then end up with multiple tabs open from stack overflow, mozilla dev network docs, youtube, and others, you can now search all at once to make it a bit more convenient. The code can easily be adjusted to add any number of websites.

Any contributions or improvements are welcome.
